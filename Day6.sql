Today's Question:

Scientists are tracking polar bears across the Arctic to monitor their migration patterns and caloric intake. Write a query to find the top 3 polar bears that have traveled the longest total distance in December 2024. Include their bear_id, bear_name, and total_distance_traveled in the results.

Table name: polar_bears

bear_id	bear_name	age
1	Snowball	10
2	Frosty	7
3	Iceberg	15
4	Chilly	5
Table name: tracking

tracking_id	bear_id	distance_km	date
1	1	25	2024-12-01
2	2	40	2024-12-02
3	1	30	2024-12-03
4	3	50	2024-12-04
